                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-neutral-200">How are Always products made? What materials are used to make them and what does the process look like? Are Always pads safe for women and girls? If you’ve always wondered about these questions, here’s a quick primer on what goes into an Always product.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-neutral-200">Read more about the safety of Always pads and other products below.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl text-gray-800 text-neutral-200">What's in Always pads?</h3>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-neutral-200">Always is designed for perfection. Our pads in the UAE and KSA, as in the rest of the world, are made of four layers, namely the top layer, the secondary top layer, the absorbent core and the back layer. Each layer helps provide comfort and protection during your most special days. They absorb fluid quickly and transfer it to the high-quality core.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl text-gray-800 text-neutral-200">The absolute safety of Always pads in the region</h3>
                    
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-neutral-200">As with all our markets, Always pads in the region are also manufactured to strict international safety standards. The well-being of our women is at the heart of every product we create. Safety assessments and formulas for Always products are reviewed by a number of independent industry experts including health authorities, university scientists and doctors. This helps us provide you with the best comfort.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl text-gray-800 text-neutral-200">How safe are Always pads?</h3>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-neutral-200">Here's how to make sure every sanitary pad that goes out to local stores and online retailers is safe to use.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl text-gray-800 text-neutral-200">Responds to the unique needs of each woman.</h3>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl text-gray-800 text-neutral-200">Use PE tape - for best quality</h3>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-neutral-200">Our products are designed using perforated films containing polyethylene (PE). This helps us maintain the quality of our products. We use PE in our products in all the countries we operate in as a means of preventing leaks. PE films are safely used in a wide range of industries:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li><p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-neutral-200">Polyethylene is a widely used ingredient in medical products such as bandages, prosthetics, and surgical sutures.</p></li>
                      <li><p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-neutral-200">It is used to preserve food in the form of food pouches, squeezable bottles, milk bottles, cereal boxes, liners, and more.</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl text-gray-800 text-neutral-200">Polyethylene membranes work in pads</h3>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-neutral-200">Polyethylene films work wonders in protecting against menstrual leaks as the ingredient keeps the fluid secure. Here are some reasons why they are effective:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li><p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-neutral-200">Polythene helps transport menstrual fluid to the absorbent core. Always uses it in fibre form as the top cover for menstrual pads.</p></li>
                      <li><p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-neutral-200">PE membranes provide a soft, silky feel. This makes the pads extremely comfortable while addressing the risk of rashes.</p></li>
                      <li><p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-neutral-200">We understand that women have unique needs. But that doesn’t mean they have to compromise. The Always Safety Promise is true for every product that leaves our factories.</p></li>
                    </ul>
